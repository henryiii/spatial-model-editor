Importing a Model
=================

To import an existing model from a SBML file, go to `File->Open SBML file` or type `Ctrl+O`.

A very simple example SBML model can be downloaded `here <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lkeegan/spatial-model-editor/master/examples/models/ABtoC.xml>`_. It has a single compartment, which contains three species: A, B, and C. The species interact via a single reaction: A + B -> C, i.e. A and B can combine to form C.

.. warning::
	Currently any spatial information in the existing model is ignored.
