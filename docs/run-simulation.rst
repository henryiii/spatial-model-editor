Running a Simulation
====================

Currently the simulation options are very limited: only non-spatial models can be simulated, using forwards Euler numerical integration.

You can specify the integrator time-step and simulation length, then press `Simulate`, and a plot of the resulting time series of concentrations will be displayed.
