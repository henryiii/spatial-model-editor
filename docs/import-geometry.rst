Importing Geometry
==================

To import an image of the compartments in the model, go to `Import->Geometry from image`.

The image should be colour coded such that each compartment has a unique colour.

Assuming you have already imported a SBML model, you can now click somewhere on the image.
The colour and compartment status boxes above the image will update to show the colour where you clicked, and the compartment assigned to this colour ("`none`" by default). To assign a compartment to this colour, click on the down arrow next to the current compartment and select the new compartment.
